I came across this lovely idea in [this article by Victoria Storm](https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/09/feel-good-mental-health-shelf.html) (article credit to Anika Ledlow). The idea is that you make a list of books, movies, articles and art, and you can use that list of pieces as a refuge, a retreat that can restore your energy. I think this exercise feels particularly appealing today:

* [Florida's getting hit by another hurricane](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/hurricane-michael-florida.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
* [The most recent UN Report says that there's a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&action=click&contentCollection=climate&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront) I will be 49 then.
  * As a side-note, I did find a [more uplifting article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/opinion/sunday/climate-change-global-warming.html) after that one.

OK, so that's how I am right now. Since the answer to the climate problem is not some specific fix, but sustained action over the course of many years. So the answer now is not to tie myself up in knots about it. So anyway, that's why I'm stressed out, and that's why I think it will be so nice to do this little exercise. So, just off the top of my head, here's what's on my list:

* _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ - Stevphen Covey
* _Walden_- Henry David Thoreau
* _Eloquent JavaScript_ - Martin Haverbeke
* [The Soundtrack to Hamilton](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kCHru7uhxBUdzkm4gzRQc) - Lin Manuel Miranda
* _On Writing Well_- William Zinsser
* _The Alchemist_ - Paulo Coelho
* _The Lord of the Rings_ - J.R.R. Tolkein
* _Meditations_- Marcus Aurelius
* _All About Love_ - Bell Hooks
* _Mating In Captivity_ - Esther Perel
* _Tiny Beautiful Things_ - Cheryl Strayed
* _The Impossible Will Take a Little While_ - Paul Rogat Loeb
* [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalley.net/)
* _Final Fantasy 7_
* _Final Fantasy 9_
* [Rain Dogs](https://open.spotify.com/album/5bbb7E51zaDCuD85uLyFkK) - Tom Waits
* Minecraft
* [Fleet Foxes](https://open.spotify.com/album/6XzZ5pg9buAKNYg293KOQ8)
* Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time
* Amalie
* Doge
* DogeCoin
* _[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)_
* Believe it or not, Dark Souls

P.S. This exercise feels so lovely I think I'm going to keep it going. More to come.
