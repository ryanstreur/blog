I'm not sure why this is, but I feel perpetually dissatisfied by the selection of apps available for reading, managing citations, and keeping notes about the things I read, and then sharing those things and notes. I figure, I'm a web developer, why not do something about it?

## a little market research on the apps which are out there

## stuff I want

* vim-style keybindings
* no mouse required
* robust jumping and hotkeys
* quick capture
