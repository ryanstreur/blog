    * They spoke with a Parisian Jew who moved to Squirrel Creek after a Kosher grocery store was shot up in Paris. His outlook, in essence, was "This kind of stuff happens no matter where you go. You always need to be careful." He also mentioned that he had been recommending that the local synagogues increase their security. He did not sound enthusiastic about having been right.

10/31 last night I folded zines with Lucy and Aria. Over thai takeout we talked about the difficulty of practicing social activism with A) full knowledge that the activity won't end once the election is over and B) that no matter how hard you work it might not go your way for reasons over which you have no control. That's vulnerability.

  * Homelessness is not some necessary evil. It has not always been with us. It is a product of deliberate policies, and can be solved with policies.
* Excellent interview with Hillary Clinton on Recode Decode with Kara Swisher.
  * At one point in the interview, Swisher asked Clinton whether she would like to run again in 2020. Clinton dodged at first, then said "well I would like to be president." In the context of their conversation it was clearly a joke about her exhasperation with the process of the 2016 election, and the fact that Trump's presidency is illegitimate. Newspapers across the country have run with the headline "Clinton says in interview she will run in 2020", willfully misinterpreting the interview because they know that headline gets clicks. Pretty shameful.
