## Internet

* [We Should Replace Facebook With Personal Websites - Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites)
* [How Much of the Internet Is Fake?](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html)
  * "Fake people with fake cookies and fake social-media accounts, fake-moving their fake cursors, fake-clicking on fake websites — the fraudsters had essentially created a simulacrum of the internet, where the only real things were the ads."
  * "Studies generally suggest that, year after year, less than 60 percent of web traffic is human; some years, according to some researchers, a healthy majority of it is bot. For a period of time in 2013, the Times reported this year, a full half of YouTube traffic was “bots masquerading as people,” a portion so high that employees feared an inflection point after which YouTube’s systems for detecting fraudulent traffic would begin to regard bot traffic as real and human traffic as fake. They called this hypothetical event 'the Inversion.'"
  * In a way, these two events have been what the internet has been leading up to all along. So much of the internet is automated, and the role humans play shrinks by the year. Human beings are simultaneously losing relevance on the internet and the only thing relevant on the internet, since the advertising model depends on the notion that human attention is valuable because that attention can turn into a purchase or a vote. The Inversion represents a point at which YouTube's own algorithms begin to prefer the traffic of bots to the traffic of humans. What would that mean?
