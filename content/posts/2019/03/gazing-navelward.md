I love reading headlines.

That's not exactly true.

I love reading tweets.

That's not exactly true either.

I've developed a funny habit. It's seemed to me that the algorithmic approach to reading the news falls short of my values. I see finding articles on Facebook and twitter as effectively ceding control over what information I have access to over to algorithms designed to maximize my platform-use time. For a while I used Pocket's recommended articles algorithm, which was quite a bit better, but that felt wrong too. The problem of algorithmic article-finding was still the same. 

Article recommendation and newsfeed algorithms are designed to maximize use-time and to [manipulate people](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html) into emotional states where they are more likely to click on ads.

I shouldn't diminish the element of novelty switching / dopamine kicking. I will often find myself engaging in a task, becoming frustrated, and almost unconsciously opening twitter of elfeed and processing headlines.

If I'm spending time on these platforms because I feel responsible for informing myself as a member of the public, I would be better off gathering a list of sources, getting their RSS links, and putting them all into an RSS reader. That way, I thought, the only people influencing the headlines I was seeing were the media companies themselves, and the only ordering mechanism was publication time. Less bias, less emotional manipulation. Excellent.

I feel like my love of reading headlines comes from a pathological need not to miss anything that happens in the world that I might be interested in.

Is it that I have to be the first to know? No, I don't think that's it, because I seldom really tell anybody else what I'm reading about or talk about the news with others (probably because I never really read the articles! :laughing:)

So it's not that I keep up out of competition with others, wanting to one-up people in conversation. 

No, none of that is true. It doesn't even really feel like keeping up with the news, to be honest. It feels more like every time I open up my RSS reader I'm presented with a list of headlines to process. Maybe this is the influence of social media. I read each headline and decide whether or not I'm interested in it. If I'm interested I save it for later, and if I'm not I mark it as read. I don't even know if I really think I'm going to go back and read all the articles I'm interested in. Maybe there's part of me that does. There's another part of me that just kind of feels like a chipmunk, stuffing my cheeks full of article links and burying them in holes for a rainy day. But I never go back. Maybe I realized this when I tried writing 

This is part of the larger story of me learning what I like and don't like.
