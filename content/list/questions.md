* Why do people say that a functional style is better suited to applications with high concurrency? 
* What does it mean to live a good life?
* What does it mean to live a good life in the context of my own life?
* Why have I always made the perfect the enemy of the good?
* What do I have to do in order to create the kinds of things I want to create? How can I create the conditions in my life which facilitate self-expression? 
* Why this hangup with the word "should?" It seems like it's too geared towards answering moral questions, whereas people like to shroud the fact that they're discussing moral issues with the notion that the object of discussion is an objective reality. 
* What would be a good way to display tabular data on a mobile device?
* What are the big advantages of end-to-end-encrypted messaging? Should I get serious about it, and recommend that my friends do too?
* How have people criticized Aristotle on the topic of Eudaimonia?
* I've heard that Chromim has some kind of built-in tracking software that reports to Google, and that was the source of much of the controversy of MS Edge moving to Chromium. Is that true?

I bought a pair of converse shoes today at a store in Seattle called the Sneakery. I went there with Anika. On our way over we talked about the cons and, actually, the pros of the centralization of shipping and fulfillment that has allowed Amazon to steal cuts of brick-and-mortar businesses all over the world. I was basically saying that it does suck for the people who are out of jobs at the brick-and-mortar stores, and also I was talking about the fact that I have heard that working at Amazon, especially in their notorious "Fulfillment Centers" is a waking nightmare. I have also heard that their corporate culture is cuthroat competitive and toxic. On the other hand, many people who work at the brick-and-mortars hate their jobs too, and there are a lot more of them than there are people at amazon. So, if we as a society can do the same amount of work more cheaply and with fewer people suffering, why shouldn't we? 

The answer, of course, is that former retail employees can no longer earn a wage because now they're out of a job. So this amazonian utopia is unachievable without a UBI.

Then we got to the store and I asked for a pair of converse. They were almost out, because evidently Converse sent out an email to all its retailers saying that they were no longer selling to retailers, and that they would henceforth be only doing business with online retailers to cut costs. Sounds like it makes business sense for them, but it was a little chilling that right after having the conversation we were having on our walk over, we were confronted with the direct consequences of the forces we were talking about.
