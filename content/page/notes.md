If I have a page of short, publicly available notes, what's the difference between those notes and tweets?

**Experiment:** Prioritize folding laundry on Sunday night

**Hypothesis:** This will make me feel good throughout the week since I don't have a hamper of clean laundry sitting in my room, and I have a place to put my dirty laundry.

**Result:** With low sample size, strong support for hypothesis. Recommend continuing.

Paper planners are good because they put you in a state of mind conducive to letting things bubble up from within. Those things are frequently the things which, when we get them done, we feel our best, since they're the things which we know deep down we need to do, not necessarily just the things which are easiest to get done given a certain way of tracking tasks.

This is the wikipedia article for isotype - surprisingly interesting, but I don't really think the term applies here in the original sense: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(picture_language)

To what extent is social media use necessary for meaningful participation in the important conversations in a given industry? It kind of feels like grubbing for attention a little bit. Can it be reframed to be approached as a contribution - an offer rather than an ask?

I've been having trouble recently getting thoughts out on paper in unstructured form for fear that they're incomplete. I am inclined to publish nothing for fear of publishing something incomplete. Who knows, maybe incomplete is worse than non-existant, but I'm betting it's not. 

One strategy for avoiding useless abstraction in programming is to get your thoughts out first, then abstract the common threads into sensible modules afterwards. It seems that a similar approach may be useful when it comes to the organization of a life.

Having a lovely evening with Anika. We made sauteed kale, a lot of roasted cauliflower, and chicken in curry sauce which was to die for. Had a weird migraine earlier, not sure what that was about. Mostly aphasia, strong headache, but uncommonly short. Counting my blessings.

Busy day today. Ended up applying for a new apartment!
