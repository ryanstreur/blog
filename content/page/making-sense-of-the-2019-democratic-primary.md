# The First Debate

## Inslee

* Excited about unions
* Excited about clean energy
* Staked candidacy on issue of climate change.
  * Does his plan save Miami?
  * Yes, first by taking the filibuster away from McConnell

## Gabbard

* Strong on foreign and security policy.
* OWNING foreign policy and security.

## Castro

* Unrivaled on immigration.
* Made O'Rourke look like an amateur.
* Killing it as the Social Justice candidate.

## Warren

* Student debt forgiveness
* No more private insurance (excellent)
* Gun violence is a public health emergency
  * "Bring data to bear"
* "Do you have a plan for how to deal with Mitch McConnell?" "I do."

## DeBlasio

* Interrupting Castro in order to pivot from Castro's pointed question on immigration policy to his own obvious idea that the Democratic Party should represent working people was not cute.
* "I've been raising a black son in this country" takes a lot of chutzpah for a white dude to play the race card with Booker on the stage.

## O'Rourke

* Plan: "Fund resiliency"

## Booker

* First to bring up murder rates of trans people.

## Amy Klobuchar

* Got a good dunk in in Trump - "We shouldn't be conducting foreign policy in our bath robes at 5:30 in the morning."
