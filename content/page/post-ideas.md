* New concepts I'm encountering through the apps I'm using for my resolutions. Maybe just a general post about my resolutions.
  * Derailment - Beeminder
  * True Expenses - YNAB

* When eating or drinking mind-altering substances, it's worth remembering that such substances, if they're naturally occurring, often evolved to be defense mechanisms whose role was to deter or destroy any organism foolhardy enough to eat it. 

* The spectrum of responsibility - from proximal to distal (in terms of location on the chain of causality), concentrated to diffuse.
  * The ethical consequences of accepting that responsibility. 

* I'm reading this book "Head First Data Analysis" and it's got me thinking. I want clarity, and I want science to be a part, no, a driving force in my life. I learned how to think scientifically in college, but I haven't really used that muscle in a rigorous way since I graduated. For example, I never conducted a literature review after graduating. So I'm reading this book about data analysis and I'm thinking to myself "a lot of this feels familiar to me. It's like science, but more jargony and more businessey. Why not go back to the discipline I kind of know instead of trying a whole new thing?" Also, "Why don't I give the scientific method a more prominent place in my life? If what I care about is truly the search for truth and the fight for justice, shouldn't the collection and rigorous analysis of evidence be central to that practice?"

* I guess this is less of a post idea than a feature idea, but it would be cool to make interactive bibliographies which used force-directed graphs with D3. I still want to figure out how to make those work well. 

* idea for an app - csv editor which uses vim keybindings. Could be an interesting way to explore what it means to react to a variety of user inputs at a lower level than I'm used to.
* Article, autobiographical, about graduation weekend.

* Post about my experience as a Jew (?)
