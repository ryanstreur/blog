Today I registered a domain name. I've been thinking about this project for a little while, and I haven't really had a name for it, and now, for better or worse, I have something to call it. I'm going to make a citation manager and I'm going to call it Marginalien.

Recently I have felt that there is too much information. To a certain extent I feel that my economic success is tied to how much information I can process, at least in the form of learning how to use new technologies. In a way, too, I've felt that my moral goodness is somehow tied to the articles I read and the shows I watch. I've felt an anxiety that the things I read slip away from me for want of writing about it, or for want of having a single place to put it that I like enough. I also want some kind of outlet for the things I learn about new technologies, and I want to design something that I care about.

I feel like I've used all the major citation managers. There are some features I like and some I don't like, and many that are shared across most citation managers. Other features I would like to see are missing altogether. Specifically, I would really like to see a citation manager with much more robust hotkey support, especially vim keybindings.

* It seems that all citation managers support some form of tagging or categorizing citations.
* Zotero, Mendeley, and Evernote (I'm not sure about EndNote) have browser extensions. These extensions save snapshots of web pages and can automatically import pdf files from academic journals, as well as determining what kind of media is on the page and saving that information accordingly.
* My main problem with Evernote's citation management is that there is not enough of a distinction between the source and the notes about the source. An Evernote user can save a source, highlight things in it, write notes in it, but if it's an online article it's as though the user is editing the HTML of the article itself. I would rather see some kind of annotation feature which draws a clear distinction between the source and the notes about the source.
* I think Zotero and Mendeley and Endnote have ways to highlight and quote specific blocks of text. Is there a browser event listener for highlighting or selecting text? [This stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3731328/on-text-highlight-event) lets you do something similar.
* I don't remember my beef with Mendeley, but I should probably go back and use it again to see what I like and don't like about it.
* There should be a way to create quotes that the user can enter in. Or maybe it should be more abstract than that, to allow room for paraphrasing. I do think that direct quotes and paraphrases should be distinct, though, but they should both allow the user to cite a specific point in the work where the reader can find the quote.
* For youtube videos, maybe citing different parts of the video can hyperlink to those time signatures in the video itself.

I have an idea for a logo - An alien with glasses reading a book.
