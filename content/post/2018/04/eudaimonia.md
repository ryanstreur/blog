description: What is the good life?
---

I check facebook like a tic. 

I open a browser window and my fingers, seemingly at no command from my mind, start in on the `Cmd+l - f - Enter` fixed action pattern. I don't know why I do it, it just happens. Skinner would be proud. No, I think I know why I do it to a certain extent. Dopamine, intermittent reward schedules, etc. The same reason I do many things which I feel unable to help doing. 

A life built of fixed action patterns is not a good life.

1. What is not a good life?

2. What is a good life?
   * Eudaimonia
   * We understand much of these sorts of things in the negative - by seeing something and saying to ourselves that that's *not* the thing we're looking for, that is. But it seems that doing the opposite is not so simple. It seems that happiness doesn't come from a sort of overcoming of unhappiness, but from transcending the problem altogether.
