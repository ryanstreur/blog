I switched things up a little bit. Used to be I had this site in a public repo, and maybe I'll still put this back in source control just to be on the safe side. For now, though, I've wiped the slate clean with this thing and just kept the content.

There was a while where I wanted quite badly to set up a git hook where I could deploy this site on commit. I'm not as interested in that at this point. Tonight I

1. Copied the content into a greenfield hugo project.
2. Cloned a theme off the hugo themes list.
3. Set up a new ubuntu droplet on digital ocean.
4. Wrote a deployment script which builds the site and deploys it in a matter of seconds.

I'm feeling pretty good about where it's at. I think I will actually put it back in a repo, maybe tomorrow.

I feel pretty pleased with it for now. Eventually I would like to set it up so it looks a little more like my personal website, and so I can use it as a platform for building fun front-end stuff.

I've hesitated to put this up, and I thought about starting fresh from the start. In the end, though, I opted for the vulnerability of having persistent, public work. We'll see how it goes.

This all started because I was having trouble installing the node_modules for the previous iteration of this site. I hadn't touched it in a while and a lot of stuff was really out of date, and it was either deprecated or having trouble installing, so I decided to wipe it clean. I don't feel like I needed to do it, and I don't feel like I gave up on it, I just feel like I went in a different direction. It's been a good time, and I feel good about what I've done. I'm going to give it a rest, but I feel energized to work on this site more in the future.
