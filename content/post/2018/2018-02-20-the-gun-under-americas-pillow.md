# Tired

I've done nothing in this fight and I'm tired, somehow. I'm tired of hoping our leaders will make serious policy changes that will be necessary to 
change the trend of violence in this country.

American identity encourages a kind of fearful paranoia, a sense that, in the prisoner's dilemma of life the other person will always try to kill you. The only way to feel safe and secure in your life, especially as a man, is to have the ability to quickly kill someone. This is also the purest expression of masculinity under this model. The best way to care for your loved ones is to give _them_ the means to quickly kill someone, or make yourself available to do it for them if they prove too squeamish.

I also suspect that I lack the capacity to say anything new or important about guns in America.

What are guns to the people who like them? 

* A way to interact communally with one-another.
* A safety blanket against fear of the other, the monster of color under the bed.
* A talisman of masculinity, of power. 
* A signifier of identity, of virtue. 
* An expression of opposition to liberal elitism and governmental tyranny. Whether this tyranny is real or imagined is immaterial to the fact that the guns contribute to the construction of the meaning.

From the outside, it seems like guns have taken on an almost mystical significance both as Objects of Power and Objects of Expression. 

What are the verifiable claims made by the proponents of ownership and by the critics of control? 

Marijuana is a controlled substance. Many agree that it should not be smoked (see N. Reagan), but why don't Americans extend the same caution to weapons of war? 
* Are weapons of war less dangerous?
* Are weapons of war more bound up with the dominantly powerful American identities?
