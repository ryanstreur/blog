* What does it say about us that we take in so much information by marinading in social media?
	 

Among the _things on my mind_ recently has been the desire to find a better way to organize my intake of information (God, what an atrocious sentence).

Two main methods for intellectual input - directed and diffuse. When people are trying to answer a specific question they use directed input. This is what happens when people use Google, for example. We go looking for specific pieces of information to answer some question or accomplish some task. Diffuse input, on the other hand, happens when we're bored or looking for something we hadn't imagined before, something we hadn't considered. This is what we're doing when we use social media - we don't know what we're going to find, but we're confident that spending some time on social media will result in some information-induced dopamine kick.

I would advocate more mindfulness in our uses of diffuse input as a society. Mindless use of social media is a big problem.

Maybe let's put it this way: I would like to achieve more mindfulness in my own use of diffuse input.

The idea that human intellectual life can be conceived as a set of inputs and outputs is a kind of premise of this piece.

How the careful regulation of oneâ€™s inputs and outputs puts one in a position to live a more healthy, balanced life.

I'm not a machine, I'm a man. Except when I'm not. During those times when I am a machine, I'd prefer to be a machine which I programmed.

Really, this piece is about nothing less than the ultimate human struggle for self-control. But is it control, really? In a certain sense we are all fighting the same internal fight - the fight between our intentional selves and our automatic selves.

But is even that true? Now I'm starting to think about what the buddhist response to such a claim might be. Maybe someone would say that that fight is illusory, and stems from a double mistake - if there is no self at all, how can there be an intentional self AND an automatic self?
