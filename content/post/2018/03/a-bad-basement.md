I had a bad dream last night. I don't quite remember how it started, but I know it was in a sort of a long, wide hallway with a door in it. The door was on one wall of the hallway, not down at the end. The other side of the hallway was half-open, like in one of those open floor plans. It was demarcated only by chest-high countertops and cabinetry, and on the other side was a kitchen. I'm not sure how I know that, thinking back on the setting, because I spent my entire time facing the doorway on the other side of the hallway.
