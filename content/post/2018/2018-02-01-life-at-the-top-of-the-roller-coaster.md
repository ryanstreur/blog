# My, What a Month

I'm going to give myself leeway in this post. I am declaring right now that it will not be perfect. This first paragraph is as much a cognitive ritual for me as it is a warning to the reader. In trying to experiment with some of my most pervasive mental patterns, I think I'll feel better about writing the rest of this post having written this bit first.  

I have had an overwhelming tendency towards perfectionism since I was very young. I would fail to learn entire songs on the guitar because I couldn't get the introductions just right, so I would practice the first minute or so of a song for hours, and repeat that behavior for years. I received two points shy of a perfect score on my ACT in high school, and I decided to take the test again because I felt like I _just shouldn't_ have missed those questions. In a conversation with my dad while we walked down a Chicago street over the last set of holidays, he quoted Voltaire at me, saying "Ryan, you've always let the perfect be the enemy of the good." I will never know what may have been, but I suspect that this habit of mind has hobbled my ability to learn and grow in more ways than I will ever know. Regardless of my neurotic suspicions, it's time to give the alternative approach an honest try. 

This is one strand in what has been a very tangled, messy, and eye-opening month for me. I've been feeling change brewing inside myself for a long time now, and it feels 2018 will only see that change accelerate. It began, as many Januaries do, with a short-lived attempt to habituate myself to going back to the gym four mornings a week. Longer-lasting than the feint at a life of fitness was my newer habit of listening to audiobooks. Below is a table of audiobooks Iâ€™ve listened to this month, when I started them, and when I finished them.

I've listened to ten books over the past month. Of these, some were about science (1, 7, 8, 10), some were about business or careers (2, 3, 6, 7, 9), and a few were about computing and technology (3, 5, 9). The one thing most of these books have in common is that they have something to say about how to coax some measure of higher performance or efficiency out of our feeble human lives (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9). I think I gravitated towards these books because I've recently had a crisis of uncertainty. I've been becalmed, and I've been looking for wind. The good news is I think I've found it. The bad news is that change is uncomfortable and, like a Hobbit, I anticipate that I'll pine for my emotional second breakfast.

# Getting to 10,000 - Wind in my Sails

The one idea which has run consistently through all the books I've listened to is the 10,000-hour rule. This is the idea that, for any particular skill, any narrow area of human endeavor, it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to achieve mastery. I haven't looked at the research myself so I admit to a certain amount of skepticism. _Any_ area of human endeavor? Not even adjusting for skills which are more or less demanding? 

While I remain skeptical about the actual number, I've found the idea incredibly motivating. This must have something to do with the books I've been reading. First, Duhigg argues that people can modify their own behavior by carefully observing the cues, behaviors, and rewards associated with habits they want to change. Then all they need to do is swap out negative behaviors for more positive ones which provide comparable rewards. Gladwell brings the number 10,000 into the picture, arguing that people we tend to think of as geniuses are really just regular people who have had extraordinary opportunities to put in their 10,000 early. Then, in So Good They Can't Ignore You, Newport gives the idea of initially choosing a career based on passion a thorough trouncing, advocating instead that people choose their professions based on the opportunity to master a challenging, valuable skill. Only then, once they have significant experience and a position much closer to the cutting edge, should they try to choose a mission for their work. Finally, Duckworth takes a different tack, saying that the most successful people are also the people who are most likely to follow through, and ties the 10,000 hour number more specifically to what she calls "deliberate practice." All these authors seem to be telling me the same thing, and what they're saying resonates with me in a way that I haven't experienced at any other time in my life. One way or another, it's time for me start down the road to 10,000. 

That's all I have time to write tonight, and in the interest of creating more and releasing more, I'm going to publish this post unedited. If I keep waiting till everything's perfect then I'll never make anything at all. It feels like this is just getting started.
