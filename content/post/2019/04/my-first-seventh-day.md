Yesterday I observed the Sabbath for the first time. It was nice to have an excuse to avoid anything which felt even remotely like work. I didn't follow the Law in a formal sense, because I don't really know what the Law is. Also because I didn't want to constrain myself artificially, and because I feel like going too far outside my comfort zone in that way may actually be more work for a beginner, not less.

Among other things, I read parts of [The Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel#The_Sabbath_(1951)), by Abraham Joshua Heschel. I found this quote in chapter one:

> "Yet law and love, discipline and delight, were not always fused. In their illustrious fear or desecrating the spirit of the day, the ancient rabbis established a level of observance which is within the reach of exalted souls but not infrequently beyond the grasp of ordinary men." - Heschel 17.

I am not an exalted soul. I am ordinary, and I want to learn to observe the Sabbath my own way. Is it about becoming closer to God for me? Is it about learning to rest? Is it about increasing my capacity to work the six days on which work is required? I'm not sure it's about any of these things. I've tried on each idea in my mind, and each feels wrong in its own way.

Maybe [Finite and Infinite Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite%5Fand%5FInfinite%5FGames) by James Carse has something to say about this. The idea there is that some games are finite in their physical and temporal boundaries, whereas infinite games are not. According to Carse, all human activity can be described in terms of finite and infinite games.  In finite games the object is to win the game based on the rules of the game, within the game's spatial and temporal boundaries. In an infinite game, the rules themselves are the materials of the game, and the object is to continue to play.

Most work, for example, is either a move in a finite game or a finite game in itself. The working calendar in the private sector is split into convenient rounds (weeks, quarters, years) and a finite space (whatever market the company happens to be in). A worker competes with her coworkers, a CEO competes with her peers at other companies, a company competes with other companies in the market.

Maybe my Sabbath is a day for setting aside finite play and enjoying infinity.
