I've just been promoted from Jr. Software Developer to Software Developer! ðŸ¥³ As a part of my new role, I'll be taking on some scrum-master responsibilities in my workplace's modified Scrum implementation. This seems like as good a time as any to write a short summary of what Scrum is, what a scrum master does, and why people should know about it.
