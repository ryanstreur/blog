What do I want to say about this?

What I could talk about:

- The therapy I've gone through over the past year.
- The conversation I had with Kristina where she recommended that I seek specialized assessment and treatment for ADD.
- The experience of being assessed for ADD.
- What I'm thinking about right now in terms of treatment.
- The struggles I had in college.
  - The coping mechanisms I've developed over the course of my life.

Where shall I begin? In the middle, of course, with the current action.

I have an appointment on Friday. At that appointment I'll speak with a nurse practitioner about treatment options and recommendations for ADD. This will be my fourth appointment with the NW ADHD Treatment Center.

## Early therapy and treatment

I was first diagnosed with ADD when I was in grade school. I remember seeing a therapist when I was very young about my parents' divorce. I don't really remember him very well. I remember his name was Jerry Kreimer (spelling?) and I remember he had blocks and toy soldiers in his office, and that I liked to play with them. I also saw a different therapist when I was in middle school. I remember his name was Michael Christensen, and I think he let me play a computer game during our sessions. I don't know which one of them first diagnosed me with ADD, but I believe it was a subtype with compromised executive functioning.

I was never sure what the treatment was when I was a kid. I was never given any medication of any kind, and I was never told about the treatment plan. I suspect that my therapists talked with my mom about treatment plans, and she may have done something that was intended as treatment. Maybe it helped, maybe it didn't, maybe it's the only reason I passed any classes at all.

I remember my mom would make me stay at the table after dinner until I finished my homework. I talked to her about it recently and she said I would just sit there doing nothing for hours, just staring into space. And when I would do my homework, she told me, I would fail to turn it in! My fifth grade teacher got so upset about it she demanded a meeting with my mom and I and, when I failed to show up, she hurt her toe kicking a tuba in the classroom.

## Recent therapy and assessment

- Started seeing a therapist last year.

## School was hard

- Chronic underachievement
- Almost flunked 8th grade math
- Almost flunked 12th grade English
  - That would have jeopardized my acceptance to college
- Almost got a D in Chem 101

## Reading Driven to Distraction

- The part about variations on ADD
  - Description of ADD with anxiety - I totally identified with this.
