I have often felt that if I just spent more time quietly thinking or writing instead of constantly filling my head with nonsense I would have a deeper sense of clarity and a greater feeling of direction. 

Notes
* System 1 vs System 2, the value of using system 2 to develop an effective system 1
* I'm just doing the same thing everyone else is doing. I'm trying to live a good life. For me, the good life is about the search for truth and the fight for justice. 
  * I'm also looking for clarity. I'm looking for clarity, truth and justice. That said, I'm not looking very hard.
