What questions do I want to answer for myself? What kinds of questions can I answer for myself? 

* Why am I where I am, doing what I'm doing? The question at the root of all my frustration.
* What do I want to accomplish while I'm here? 
* Where do I want to go?

These are the vision questions, the most vexing ones. 

I wonder if this regular commit thing is becoming too oppressive - how do I build a - no, cultivate a - habit of creativity without it derailing other parts of my life? Is that even the point, creativity?
