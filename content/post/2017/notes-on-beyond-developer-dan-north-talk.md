* The first ten minutes or so is an engaging and entertaining re-hash of the early history of software dev - Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Babbage, etc. 
* Moves on to talk about Scrum, Agile manifesto
* "embarrassment-driven refactoring"
* You need to learn - LEARN - your language. 
* Interesting point near 31:00 about scrum: North posits that a lot of people think it's the scrum master's job to remove obstacles, but it's not. Really, it's the team's job to remove obstacles and the scrum master is just a coach. He says something similar about the PO role. I'm inclined to agree, but this isn't the place to flesh it out.
* Advances the somewhat revolutionary notion that developers are more motivated and more productive if they're interested and invested in what they're working on. Uses the banking example - you're not 'just working at a bank', you're helping build a financial system, the wiring which lets your neighbor pay for his mortgage, or which lets immigrants send money back home to their families. 
  * Sure, I get this on a certain level. This makes sense on a certain level.
