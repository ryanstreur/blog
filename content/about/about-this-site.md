I'm trying to do a few things with this website. I'm trying to

* build a place on the internet which I control, where I can express myself and keep track of my thoughts.
* figure out my favorite way to deliver a pretty standard blog / personal website experience
* learn the skills I'd like to learn while building it, and keep up on the skills I already have
* make something Good

## TODO

* Add better styling
* Add CI/CD
* Put the deployment pipeline back together
