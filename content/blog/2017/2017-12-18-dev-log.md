Starting yesterday and running through this morning I tried and failed to set up automatic build and deployment using Wercker. It was a pain, and I didn't end up setting it up to do what I want it to do, but I learned a few things and I don't regret the time I spent.

I had a number of problems with this process. I was working from a couple of tutorials, but the nature of my site is such that the CI/CD solutions I was trying to set up were a little overkill. This site is built with Hugo, a static site generator, so a lot of the concerns that come up when you're figuring out how to deploy a server-run website don't really apply. 

I started with [ this tutorial ](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-wercker/) on how to set up CD for Hugo sites serving on GH-Pages, but that actually wasn't sophisticated _enough_. In the past I've always hosted my static sites on DigitalOcean, and I wanted to set up my CD solution to deploy to my droplet. So, after a little googling around, I found [ this Medium post ](https://medium.com/@davegri/deploying-web-applications-to-digital-ocean-with-wercker-addf702d5e65) with instructions on how to use wercker and docker to set up CD for your DO-hosted application. It was overkill, but I though, hey, what the hell, it'll be fun. It was fun, but (spoiler alert) I failed to set up automatic deployment.

The first thing I got wrong was basic YAML syntax. I copied and pasted part of the `wercker.yml` I found in that medium post, and I started getting an error about bad indentation in a mapping key or something. It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out where the syntax error was and why it was throwing. Ultimately, I solved that problem by installing a VS-Code YAML extension, which pointed out the error, said specifically what was wrong with it, but still didn't bring me to the point where I could fix it. Ultimately I ended up installing a YAML extension for VS-Code. That told me where the error was and what was the matter with it, but for some reason I still couldn't YAML to cooperate. I wound up just deleting the whole thing and typing it out by hand, if you can believe it. That worked.

Next, there was a problem with Wercker's built-in add-to-known\_hosts step. I should have noticed this earlier, but when I'd re-typed everything I typed it in as 'add-to-known-hosts,' not 'add-to-known\_hosts'. Serves me right for typing it out by hand. 

Finally, and this was the problem that I couldn't figure out in the end, trying to configure my Wercker step to ssh into my droplet and run my deployment script consistently threw `host key verification failed`. I tried everything I could think of short of destroying and rebuilding the droplet, but nothing seems to work in this case. I'm 95% sure the culprit is my own novitiate understanding of Wercker, and there's probably one little tidbit of information which would have changed everything if I'd had it, but I didn't. 

I'm not too worried about it, though. By the end of it all I'd configured the droplet to the point where I can simply run `ssh ryanstreur.com "cd ryanstreur.com && npm run build-prod"` and it builds the damn thing straight into the folder Nginx is watching, so really it's not _that_ much more work than having it build and deploy automatically on `git push`. I also learned a few neat things about 

* Wercker (of course)
* YAML (yuck, though it might grow on me)
* Docker (though only a little)
* shell scripting
* the ssh protocol

so I say this was time well-spent.
