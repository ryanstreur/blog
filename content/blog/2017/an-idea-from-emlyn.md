Emlyn is my housemate. This is Emlyn's idea of a good time: 
* Anchor tag, so `<a>`.
* When the user hovers over the anchor tag, it moves out from under the mouse in a random direction. 
* It begins with a velocity counter which diminishes over time. So, in effect, the user has to tire out the link by chasing it around the screen till the velocity counter ticks down.
