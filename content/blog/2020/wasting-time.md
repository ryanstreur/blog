[Scott Hanselman wrote a post in 2010](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx) and [another in 2012](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx) about how many keystrokes go to waste in chats and emails that could benefit far more people if they were written up and shared. He's still right. I think about it a lot but so far I haven't really taken his advice.

I have this persistent feeling that the energy I spend reading, watching, and thinking about things goes to waste. I feel like I'm wasting time, and I don't want to, yet I continue to slip into the same patterns when left unattended. Partly a distinction between mindfulness and mindlessness - the habit part of my mind wants to think as little as possible, and the easiest way to do that is to do the same thing I've done for a long time.

The only way to overcome a pattern, or at least the only way that's worked for me, is to first notice that you're about to fall into into the pattern, or notice that you're in it. Actually, come to think of it, I usually notice once it's been going on for a while and I feel some discomfort about it. I usually don't know where this discomfort comes from at first, but when I stop to think about it (IF I stop to think about it) I realize it's becuase part of me has led me down a path another part of me doesn't like, and that causes me pain.

At that point I sometimes try to redirect myself, but it usually depends on [how many spoons I have left for the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory). A lot of the time I just continue to do the thing that's easy, but that doesn't get me closer to where or who I want to be. I usually feel a sense of relief from doing the easy thing, combined with a sense of frustration with myself and anxiety that I'll never change, or that I'm taking too long to change.

What would my therapist say? I'm sure she would tell me to be kinder to myself, and to accept the situation for what it is so I can just move on. I bet she wouldn't use the word "just," though. What is it in DBT? If you can fix it, do. If you can't fix it, change the way you feel about it. Something like that.

I'm also feeling tired because I worked a super long day yesterday, so that may be where some of my feelings of dissatisfaction are coming from today. I also didn't take care of myself yesterday, really, or today if I'm honest.

It's been hard for me to regulate how much I work these days. Definitely hard for me to regulate how much I sit at the computer. COVID sucks.

Writing about all this helps, though.
