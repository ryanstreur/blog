- Learned about the super-fast [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) command, and also learned about the [time](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Unix)>) command so I could tell just how fast it was. Between hugo and rsync, this site can usually build and deploy in under ten seconds. ðŸ˜²
- Today (11/15/2019) I learned all about how [Chrome will soon be removing support for Synchronous HTTP requests from unload events](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4664843055398912). Fascinating topic!
- Reading the Hugo [output format](https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats) documentation, wondering what the heck AMP is! There's so much I don't know!
- Reading about the [anchor tag](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) (curious about [rel](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#attr-hyperlink-rel)).
