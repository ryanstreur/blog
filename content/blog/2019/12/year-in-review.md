What a year this has been. Holy shit.

So much in my life has changed even just over the last few months. 

- My girlfriend and I adopted two perfect cats.
- My girlfriend and I decided to end our relationship after six and a half years
- I had my ADHD diagnosis reaffirmed and started taking Adderall to treat it.
- I took on new and challenging responsibilities at my job.
- I found a new job.

## Cats

Should include a still from the movie cats.

Between all these events, my day has changed completely. First, the cats got sick shortly after we adopted them. Sal developed an upper respiratory infection, which meant that we had to keep them separated. It was a bummer, since my apartment doesn’t have a door between the bedroom and the main living space. The only interior door in my apartment is the door to the bathroom, so Frankie lived in the bathroom for a while. We took Sal to the vet when we he kept sneezing, and they told us he had an upper respiratory, and that he would need daily oral medication for it. That meant a pill gun.

I should include a picture of a pill gun here.

If you’ve never used a pill gun before, I would not recommend it. Here’s how the process tended to go: First I would spread out a towel with some Feliway on it. I would pick up Sal and put him on the towel. Then I would get his legs under control and swaddle all of him except his head in that towel.  I would hold him in that towel while my girlfriend got his mouth open and gave him the pill and then the syringe squirt of water. He hated nothing more, and he got wise to the ritual pretty darn quick.

About a week after we adopted him, Sal’s nose fell off. I shit you not, know how cat noses are kind of T-shaped? One Friday we came home and the bottom part of that T - the line going down - was super bloody, and looked like it had been cut back like an eighth of an inch. It was horrifying. It felt like it was my fault. My girlfriend felt like it was her fault. It was terrible. She called the vet and they told us to give him a cone so he didn’t fuss at it. I remember I was taking a friend of mine to her lab at OHSU that day, and I went to pick up the cone right away after that. 

Sal hated his cone. The first time we put it on it was really disorienting for him. His eyes got wide, and he crouched For a second. Then he started backing up. And back, and back, and back, in circles through the kitchen and around the living room. Poor baby. Later it seemed like he just got super sad about it. He didn’t really move around very much while he was in his cone. He had trouble getting into his litter box. He would walk up to the litter box the way he normally would, then the bottom of the cone would bump into the rim of the litter box. Sal would back up, bewildered and defeated. He had to use the litter box during one of his cone breaks. My girlfriend stayed home with him those days, and I was so grateful. 

Actually, I remember something now. At first I thought Sal has licked his nose off. My thinking was that he had a lot of snot in his nose and he must have been licking it excessively. I thought his rough tongue must have abraded his nose away.

I’ve had to give both my cats another course of oral medication and I’ve been using pill pockets and it’s so, so much better.

## The year ahead

I've been asking some of the people I tend to encounter on a day-to-day basis what they want out of 2020. I've gotten a lot of good answers, and those answers have helped me think about my own.
