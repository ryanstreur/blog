Over the past couple weeks I've been discovering the joys of Emacs. Something about the minimal and infinitely customizeable UI makes my heart sing. There's a beautiful synchronicity to pulling ever more functionality into this one simple text-based interface. I've used it to read pdfs (leaves something to be desired), organize and read rss feeds (excellent), and write to-do lists and outlines (sublime). I haven't taken the plunge into [learning elisp properly](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html) yet, but I feel myself moving closer and closer to the precipice.

Benefits to using [Spacemacs](http://develop.spacemacs.org/):

* Customizeable UI
* Lovely vim-style keybindings
* Space-bar commands of infinite variety and function
* [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/) is incredible. I started using Emacs for that specifically, and it's become the editor's killer feature for me.
* Much of the configuration is abstracted into what Spacemacs calls "configuration layers". It still takes some config effort, but the layers make it easier to pull in packages of functionality without having to know every little thing about every little package.

Drawbacks to using Spacemacs:

* Steep learning curve (you basically need to be a hobbyist devoting significant amounts of spare time to learn it)
* Kind of a poor symbol-jumping story compared to VS-Code - you need to use a special program to create tagfiles which keep track of which symbols point to definitions in which files, and I haven't been able to get it to work yet. With VS-Code, on the other hand, most of that behavior is built into the editor or into the extensions for particular languages.

## Here's a twitter thread I wrote today

## Some things I've been paying attention to published this past week

### Climate

* Some scientists are [worried about declining groundwater resources](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw8z5j/were-sitting-on-a-groundwater-time-bomb-scientists-warn), and others are concerned that ["Greenland's melting ice is nearing a tipping point"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/climate/greenland-ice.html?partner=rss&emc=rss)
* Apparently Bill Gates is going to save the day by funding $1b worth of nuclear reactors - [Slashdot](http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/fDefGUSJTgg/bill-gates-promises-congress-1-billion-to-build-nuclear-reactors-for-fighting-climate-change)

  * I think there's a relevant section about this phenomenon in _How to Kill Everybody_ by Bruce Schneier.

### Science

* Remember the Chinese scientist who claims to have successfully used CRISPR-CAS9 on human embryos? Sounds like [things are not looking so good for him](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwb854/scientist-who-gene-edited-babies-will-be-dealt-with-seriously-chinese-investigators-say);
* COoL I love when anti-vaccers CAUSE MEASLES OUTBREAKS ONE COUNTY OVER FROM ME YAY - [OPB](https://www.opb.org/news/article/clark-county-measles-outbreak-now-up-to-31-confirmed-cases/)

### Tech

* [Ars-Technica Science - Social Media Can Predict What You'll Say, Even if You Don't Participate](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/social-media-can-predict-what-youll-say-even-if-you-dont-participate/)

#### Dev

* [_Ontology is overrated - Categories Links and Tags_](http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html)
* [_Confessions of an Abstraction Hater_](http://250bpm.com/blog:144)

### Misc

* [The University of the Third Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Third_Age) is an interesting concept that I hadn't come across before it showed up on Hacker News, but I think it's a good one. In a nutshell, I think people are built for fun and exploration, not for leisure, and I like the idea of a place where people can continue to explore essentially forever. My own personal take on this idea has been that I never plan to retire - rather, I plan to take on professions where my performance does not depend on my physical ability.

* [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) on the perennial problem of picking a career.
