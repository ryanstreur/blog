I've made a lot of new year's resolutions in my life, and I've broken just as many. Like many, I have a list of things which I envision an ideal version of myself doing regularly. Going to the gym, cooking for myself, meditating, reading, and writing are the big five. I've made resolution after resolution about those things, and I can usually last two or three months. Then it's back to baseline, like nothing ever happened.

2018 went a little better, actually. The resolutions were pretty simple - read 52 books and write 12 blog posts. I failed at both, but I actually did do more than I ever did towards any of the more diffuse resolutions. But it wasn't because of the fact that the goals were well-defined or quantifiable. I think I lost track of what I resolved probably around March. I did well last year because I picked things I really wanted to do.

Here are a couple aspirations for 2019:

I want to do what I want to do. More difficult than it sounds, believe it or not. In July, when I started seeing my current therapist, I had nearly no idea what I wanted. She asked me repeatedly and every answer I gave her was totally focused on someone else and their needs. I have been focused on others' needs all my life, and I think a good 2019 is one where I focus on my own. I've been getting better at it with practice, and I want to continue down that road.

Right now I'm not sure what the implementation is exactly, but I think it would be fun to take another crack at the 52 books and the 12 blog posts. If that stops being fun, though, I'll pick a different thing to do. The point is to learn to distinguish when I'm doing something when I want to be and when I'm doing something because I feel like I should.

Happy New Year
