This is part of my wasted keystrokes initiative.

In my understanding, "content" typically refers to the content served on a web site for public consumption, and a content management system would typically refer to something like Wordpress. The key distinction there is between the website and the content it delivers. It implies a group of authors and an audience, which is kind of true, but it seems that this may not match the goal.
  
But what many businesses really need is a more comprehensive solution for the management of the company's knowledge, so knowledge management may be a more appropriate framework for understanding the problem. Rather than authors and an audience, it may be more useful to think of a group of contributors to a shared knowledge base. In the context of many businesses, the knowledge base is SharePoint and employees are all contributors. The author/audience framework will still be necessary for some kinds of top-down communications, but it seems like most of the information produced at knowledge-work organizations may fit better in the knowledge management framework.

It seems like the usefulness of such a knowledge base is directly proportional to how easy it is to learn what you need to know and, often, THAT you need to know it in the first place. Further, a knowledge base's usefulness is inversely proportional to how difficult it is to contribute to it, or how easy it is for contributions to add accidental complexity to the structure of the knowledge. It seems like one of the pain points of Sharepoint and Teams is that it's relatively unstructured, so contributors must know the conventions for contribution, and be disciplined in their application in order to maintain the quality of the shared knowledge. This is difficult, so it increases the overhead costs associated with maintaining knowledge quality and increases the likelihood of contributions which make the system more chaotic and harder to interact with and understand.
